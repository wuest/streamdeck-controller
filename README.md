# streamdeck-controller

Provides an interface for configuration and operation of an
[Elgato Stream Deck][main_0].

## Current Status
Does not work even a little bit.  Currently will enumerate Stream Decks from
the command line and exit.

## Contributing
Contributions are enthusiastically welcomed!  Feel free to open issues and pull
requests.  All participants and maintainers are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct][contributing_1].

## Acknowledgements
Made much easier thanks to the work of [Lange][ack_0] on the
[elgato-stream-deck][ack_1] Node project.
